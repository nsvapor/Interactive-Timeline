                    <span class="people">Zhang Xieren</span> is born in the

                    <p>
                      Zhang Xieren was one of the most influential people in
                      Korukkan history. Born to a constable and an unknown
                      mother, he fought in the Eastern War at the age of 16
                      before he returned home at the war's conclusion. Injured
                      and deemed unable for further military service, he married
                      and joined the civil administration of the Great
                      Undertaking in Tungnir.<br /><br />
                      Rising through its ranks quickly, he was officially made
                      Provincial Administrator for South-Eastern Tungnir, but
                      served in practicality as mayor of the border town of
                      Ortooroi and doubled as its censor. Here he helped bring
                      down the infamous Spectral Seven and tamed much of the
                      land, resulting in his appointment as Vice-Commandant and
                      eventually Commandant of the Great Undertaking. He
                      catapulted from this success by joining the SECOND
                      Initiative by 1910, taking complete control by 1912.<br /><br />
                      Here, Zhang pushed forward several goals counter to that
                      of the Empire: he expanded West Pahadan Rail to control a
                      swathe of vassals and territory, whilst building up an
                      economy and military to further his goals. He led the
                      Imperial Army in Pahada during the 'Western War' and
                      oversaw the Pavlostani surrender aboard
                      <i>Weakness</i>.<br /><br />
                      A staunch constitutional monarchist, Zhang Xieren was the
                      head of the elusive Five Star Committee. As trouble brewed
                      in Clockwork, Zhang and his Five Star Committee, including
                      their highly trained and seasoned military that had fought
                      in Pahada a few years before, invaded the rebelling
                      territories of the empire and officially declared it
                      dissolved in 1948, succeeded by an
                      <span class="country">Imperial Federation</span> that
                      politically resembled Zhang's ideological beliefs. He
                      served as Supreme Chancellor for a term, where he reunited
                      much of the nation and oversaw the return of several port
                      cities back to Korrukan control.<br /><br />
                      'The Father of the Federation' retired to a humble life
                      back in his home of Xia, where he took control of a large
                      farm and ranch. He died in 1977, survived by three
                      children.
